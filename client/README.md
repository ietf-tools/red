## Development

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

### Install

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

### Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
```

### Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview
```

### Editor

#### VSCode

Install `Prettier` extension (and you probably want to choose the default formatter as _'Prettier - Code formatter'_ and enable _'Editor: Format on save'_).
