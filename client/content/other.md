### How to Use XML to Create an Internet-Draft ([video](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JrZpF7O07U&t=160s) | [PDF](//datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/104/materials/slides-104-edu-sessf-how-to-create-an-internet-draft-using-xml-or-markdown-xml2rfc-00.pdf))

This tutorial shows how to use an XML source file to generate an I-D using xml2rfc and highlights the changes to the XML vocabulary, which is referred to as “v3”. (March 2019)

### Document Lifecycle ([PDF](/materials/lifecycle82.pdf))

**Description:** This tutorial offers an overview of producing documents in the IETF from version 00 of an Internet-Draft to publication as an RFC. We will cover the working group process and the required and suggested contents of an Internet-Draft, including information from IANA staff about writing IANA Considerations sections. We will walk through the lifecycle of an Internet-Draft, including authorship, WG draft, IETF Last Call, IESG evaluation, and what to expect during the RFC publication process. We will provide a set of helpful hints to authors about formatting rules and editorial policies that often improve the quality of the resulting documents. We will summarize the states of the RFC publication process and provide an opportunity to ask questions of RFC Editor staff.

### RFCs and the RFC Editor ([PDF](/materials/tutorial76.pdf))

**Description:** This tutorial covers the basics that are required to understand the metadata related to an RFC (e.g., updates/obsoletes relationships, [status changes](/status_changes/), and [errata](/errata/)). This session also describes the publication process and provides some tips for writing good RFCs.
