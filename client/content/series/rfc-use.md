# How Can I Use RFCs?

RFCs are freely available to download, copy, publish, display, and distribute, in a variety of formats, under a license granted by the [IETF Trust](https://trustee.ietf.org/). This license, the [Trust Legal Provisions](https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/tlp-5/), has some important restrictions, including a prohibition on modification of RFCs outside of the IETF Standards Process.

RFCs are not guaranteed to be patent-free and anyone interested in the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) constraints on a specific document should consult the IETF's [IPR disclosure database](https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/), though this is not guaranteed to be a complete record of applicable patents.

You may [download RFCs in bulk](/series/rfc-download/).
