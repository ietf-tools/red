# Document Clusters in Queue

Most often, a document cluster is a set of two or more RFCs that are normatively related and moving through the queue together. Clusters are based on the principle that a [normative reference](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/statement-iesg-iesg-statement-normative-and-informative-references-20060419/) must be published before or simultaneously with the document that references it. For example, if Internet-Draft A has a normative reference to Internet-Draft B, and Internet-Draft B has a normative reference to Internet-Draft C, then Internet-Drafts A, B, and C would be in one cluster and would need to be published with those relationships in mind. These documents would move through the queue , labeled with the same Cluster ID. (e.g., cluster C508).

Documents that are normatively referenced by other documents but do not themselves have any normative references to [Internet-Drafts](https://www.ietf.org/participate/ids/) may move forward in the process independently of the other documents in the cluster.

Clusters may include documents that are not in the queue:

- **NOT-RECEIVED**. This document is not yet in the RFC Editor publication queue.
- **PUB**. This document has already been published as an RFC.

Clusters may include documents that are linked by normative references indirectly. See [MISSREF Generation Numbers](/authors/rfc-edit/pub-queue/#definitions-of-flags) for more information.

Other documents may move through the RFC [publication process](/authors/rfc-edit/) together as a cluster if there was a specific request from the IESG or authors for simultaneous publication.
