# How to Write an RFC

![Draft & approval via IETF or other streams → Editing by the RFC Production Center (RPC) → Official RFC publication on rfc-editor.org](/images/authors/rfc-how-to-flowchart.png)

RFCs all begin as [Internet-Drafts](https://authors.ietf.org/#introducing-internet-drafts) (I-Ds) that have been adopted by an [IETF working group](https://www.ietf.org/process/wgs/) or by one of the other streams for document publication.

Each publication stream has its own processes for authoring and approving I-Ds. Refer to the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/process/), [IRTF](https://www.irtf.org/), [IAB](https://www.iab.org/role/evaluating-new-work-proposals/), [Independent](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GIzY1ZT_PJTOxacaFkAauUZ2p3eMPtui_v5RKORjyiw/edit#heading=h.y5hej3hkyt7v) or [Editorial](https://datatracker.ietf.org/edwg/rswg/about/) Streams for more information on how to start.

Internet-Draft authors can find current authoring guidelines on the [Internet-Draft Author Resources](https://authors.ietf.org/) page.

When an I-D is approved for publication, it is sent to the RFC Production Center (RPC) for professional editing. The [editorial process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GIzY1ZT_PJTOxacaFkAauUZ2p3eMPtui_v5RKORjyiw/edit#heading=h.voazx5oztalq) includes accuracy checks and editing for grammar, consistency, and continuity. All changes are approved by the authors before the editorial process concludes.

The official RFC is then published on rfc-editor.org. Once published, the content of an RFC does not change. However, an RFC may be obsoleted or updated (check the metadata), and [errata](/series/rfc-errata/) may be filed against them.

You can learn more about the conventions used in RFCs on the “[Tips for Reading RFCs](/series/rfc-tips/)” page.
