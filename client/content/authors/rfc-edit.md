# RFC Editorial Process (/authors/rfc-edit/) {#rfc-editorial-process-(/authors/rfc-edit/)}

The [IETF,](https://www.ietf.org/) [IAB](https://www.iab.com/), [IRTF](https://www.irtf.org/), [Independent](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GIzY1ZT_PJTOxacaFkAauUZ2p3eMPtui_v5RKORjyiw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.y5hej3hkyt7v), and [Editorial](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/rswg/about/) Streams produce Internet-Drafts that are approved for publication by each streamâ€™s own processes (see [How to Write an RFC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GIzY1ZT_PJTOxacaFkAauUZ2p3eMPtui_v5RKORjyiw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.c0tdtw9dvbjc)). Once the approval steps are completed, the document is submitted to the RFC Production Center (RPC) for editing, formatting, and publication as an RFC.

Documents can be tracked through the states of the RPC editing process using the [Current Publications Queue](/authors/rfc-edit/pub-queue/). See the [flow chart of the editorial process](#publication-flow-chart) for more information

The RPC edits and formats the documents. Then, the RPC works with the authors to produce a publication-ready RFC in a process called [AUTH48](/authors/rfc-edit/auth48/). This step allows the authors to review the changes made by the RPC, take one final look over their document for errors, editorial and otherwise, and make any necessary changes before publication.

After this last step, the RPC publishes the RFC by sending an announcement to the [ietf-announce](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-announce) and [rfc-dist](https://mailman.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-dist) mailing lists.
