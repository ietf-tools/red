A quick lesson on nroffing....

Nroffing is a process of formatting a document using commands called
macros that are essentially two letters preceded by a period and
sometimes followed with a number, for example: .in 3 (which means
indent following text by 3 spaces)

Basic nroff commands:

.in # = # is the number of spaces you want the text indented, this
command will be in place until you put in a new .in command...if you
want something to not be indented you put in .in 0

.bp = break page

.ti # = .ti also indents but only for one line, so if you have one
sentence that needs to be indented 8 spaces but the rest of the page
is indented 3 you can use .ti 8 for that single sentence

.ce # = centers by the # of sentences you enter

.ne # = keeps the # of lines together (avoids widows)

.fi = fill-in, extra space will be ignored and text that is entered
like this, the fill-in command will continue until you enter a .nf
command and vice-versa

  .fi
  the quick brown fox
  jumps over
  the lazy dog

 will look like this
 
  the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

.nf = no-fill, you use for graphs or text that you don't want spaces
to be ignored...so

  .nf
  the quick brown fox
  jumps over
  the lazy dog

 will look like this

  the quick brown fox
  jumps over
  the lazy dog 

Also, all nroff commands must be all the way to the right, the nroff
program recognizes the period as a command only if it is all the way
to the left of the document.

So...if a document is formatted like this:

.nf

Don't worry about how to actually run the nroff program, just send
me text with the nroff commands and I will do the rest.


THANKS!!!
